# PetStore Project

Welcome to the **PetStore** project repository! This project was developed incrementally over several weeks, with each week introducing new features, concepts, and improvements. The branches in this repository are organized by week, allowing you to easily track the progression and evolution of the application over time. Below, you will find the steps I took to complete the project on a weekly basis. Each branch contains the specific changes and additions made during that particular week, showcasing the application's development phase by phase.

# Week 1

In Week 1, I established the foundational structure of the PetStore application by creating classes with essential properties and fields, focusing on key object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation and inheritance. I implemented a console application that manages user input, allowing for the instantiation of product objects and basic application flow control using loops and conditional logic. Additionally, I introduced exception handling to demonstrate error management in the application. This foundational work sets the stage for further development in subsequent weeks.

# Week 2

In Week 2, I enhanced the PetStore application by implementing collections, specifically utilizing `List<Product>` and `Dictionary<string, DogLeash>`. I added functionality that allowed users to search for product names using dictionary key-value pairs, solidifying my understanding of collection manipulation. This included creating methods for adding products and retrieving details, reinforcing key programming concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance.

# Week 3

In Week 3, I focused on enhancing the PetStore application by implementing robust error handling and reinforcing object-oriented programming principles. I introduced a `try-catch` block in the `GetDogLeashByName` method within the `ProductLogic` class to manage potential exceptions, preventing application crashes when a product is not found. Additionally, I created a new `DryCatFood` class that inherits from `CatFood`, encapsulating properties specific to dry cat food, which improved the organization and clarity of the product attributes. The `Weight` property was relocated to this new class, demonstrating effective use of inheritance.
